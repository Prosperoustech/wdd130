                <p>Good day, my name is Prosper Bright, I am from Lagos, Nigeria.
                    I am an animal lover, the reason I keep two dogs and a cat. I 
                    am a student of Brigham Young University Idaho and currently 
                    pursuing a degree in Software Development. I already have a 
                    degree in Computer Science, I am studying Software 
                    Development so as to get a better employment. It has 
                    really been hectic studying but because I am sure it's
                    worth it, I've got to give it all I can. I hope 
                    to train as many people as possible as soon as 
                    I'm done with my studies training people is also 
                    a way of learning, knowing fully well that the more 
                    I teach the more I learn, that's one strategy I want to use to get better at what I do
                </p>
